<h1 align="center"><img  src="https://rajivpandit.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/python.png" width="600"></h1>

This repository contains programs written for the Higher-level programming track at the ALX Software Engineering Program. In these projects, I learnt Python & SQL, and I also made use of concepts learnt.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. 

## The specific list of projects contained follows:

- [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
- [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
- [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
- [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
